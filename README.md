List of posable skills. Java, py, and php work in conjuction to provide a basic application using Postgres; providing a login template, desktop app, working as "debt collection" which you type in a username/password and credit info to pay off. These applications involve use of Java Swing for interface, Flask; the python web backend for data structuring on some of the pages. Though rundundant, and considered bad practice, I used flask and php for the backend for the experience and learning aspect for the project rather than emulate step to step how a commercial application would function.
